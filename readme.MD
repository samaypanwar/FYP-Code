## Final Year Project

#### Bond Pricing

In this branch, we are interested in estimating the a, b variables in the vasicek model
on top of deterministic volatility rather than estimating parameters for the forward curve parameterisation

#### Directory Structure:

helper

* parameterization
* sythesize data

plotting

* this that curve

notebooks

* testing out the stuff done in notebooks

data

* stores the data files needed for analysis
